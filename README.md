# DrainingVein

The MATLAB scripts 'extractDataTables.m' and 'extractData_Meningeal.m' were authored by Kira Shaw and load in the original hemodynamic time series per locomotion event for the artery, whisker vein, draining vein ('extractDataTables') and meningeal vein ('extractData_Meningeal'), before normalising the data to the pre-locomotion event period (calls function 'findDeltaF' authored by Kira Shaw), and extracting the corresponding labelling information (animal ID, vessel type, session ID, group ID, sex) and time series metrics such as maximum peak and minima (calls function 'getTraceParam' authored by Kira Shaw). These data are saved as mat files and data tables saved as spreadsheets which are available on Orda (https://figshare.com/s/6c14d85c98fb7e7d4e44), and loaded into RStudio for statistical analyses ('plotStats_dvpaper.rmd').
